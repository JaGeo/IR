# IR

This python package can calculate infrared intensities from the dipole approximation. To do so, you need VASP and Phonopy.

It is based on the following two publications:
P. Giannozzi and S. Baroni, J. Chem. Phys. 100, 8537 (1994). 

and

D. Karhánek, T. Bučko, J. Hafner, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 22 265006 (2010). 

They should be cited if you use the program. Of course, also VASP and Phonopy.

Intallation

To use this package you need to install Phonopy correctly. Furthermore, numpy is required.
