This python package can calculate infrared intensities from the dipole approximation. To do so, you need VASP and Phonopy. 

It is based on the following two publications:
P. Giannozzi and S. Baroni, J. Chem. Phys. 100, 8537 (1994). 

and

D. Karhánek, T. Bučko, J. Hafner, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 22 265006 (2010).
