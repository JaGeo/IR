# IR

This python package can calculate infrared intensities based on the dipole approximation. To do so, you need [```VASP```](https://www.vasp.at/) and [```Phonopy```](https://github.com/atztogo/phonopy). 
<hr></hr>
It is based on the following two publications: 

1. P. Giannozzi, S. Baroni, *J. Chem. Phys.*, **1994**, *100*, 8537. 

2. D. Karhánek, T. Bučko, J. Hafner, *J. Phys.: Condens. Matter.*, **2010**, *22*, 265006.

They should be cited if you use the program. Of course, also [```VASP```](https://www.vasp.at/) and [```Phonopy```](https://github.com/atztogo/phonopy).

Intallation
-----------
To use this package you need to install [```Phonopy```](https://github.com/atztogo/phonopy) correctly. Furthermore, ```numpy``` is required. Also, the python path should be exported correctly.
